I am sorry I forgot to add the reference on the internet that i used to get the hang around the linked list deletion part 
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/delete-a-linked-list-node-at-a-given-position/

I also got some help from my friends cause i had a huge memory leak (the lldb issue in Xcode) with the code!
